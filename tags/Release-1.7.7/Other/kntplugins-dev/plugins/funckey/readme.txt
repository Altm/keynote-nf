This is a sample plugin for KeyNote.
This plugin requires KeyNote version 0.999 or higher.

TO INSTALL:
Unzip the plugin file into the "\plugins" subdirectory, 
below the directory where KeyNote is installed. For example, 
if KeyNote is installed in
	c:\Program Files\Keynote
then the plugin file should be placed in
	c:\Program Files\Keynote\Plugins
This subdirectory is created by the Setup program. You can
create it manually, if necessary.

See "plugins.txt" in KeyNote's "\doc" subdirectory
for information on installing and using plugins.

-----------------------------------------------------------

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

This plugin enables you to customize a range of function key 
assignments in KeyNote. Currently, only a limited selection
of commands can be assigned to function keys. These commands are:

	- execute a macro
	- execute a plugin
	- apply a named style to text
	- select text font
	
The following ranges of function key shortcuts can be assigned:
	Alt+F1 - Alt+F3; Alt+F5 - Alt+F12
		(Alt+F4 is reserved by Windows)
	Shift+Alt+F1 - Shift+Alt+F12
	Ctrl+Alt+F1 - Ctrl+Alt+F12
	
-----------------------------------------------------------
	
Future versions of KeyNote may allow for more flexibility
in customizing keyboard shortcuts. However, current version
of KeyNote has some design limitations which allow for only
the kind of key customization that this plugin offers.

PLEASE DON'T ASK ME to expand the key customization feature.
It cannot be done until KeyNote is seriously redesigned.
