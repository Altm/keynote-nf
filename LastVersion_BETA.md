For those of you who want and can test new funcionality before new version is released:<br>
<br>
This executable (<b>1.7.7 Beta</b>) includes the following issues:<br>

<b>I forgot to say that language files (.lng) are specific to each version. So, if Beta version doesn't include languages files, you will have to try it in English</b>

Soon I will publish a new BETA (this one with language files included, probably) with the following improvement: all the functionality of the program will manage properly UNICODE strings.<br>

<br>
I recommend everybody to use this new version, although marked as Beta but remember:<br>
<br>
- Beta releases include normally only 'keynote.exe'. In this case are also included: 'kntutils.dll', 'nodehead.rtf' and 'notehead.rtf'. The .rtf files are needed if you are having problems with export, specially with chinese language.<br>
<br>
You must download previously a complete version and then replace existing files with the ones included in the .rar file<br>
<br>
- Also, and important, the language files are associated to specific versions and so the language files will not be compatible with the beta executable. It is necessary that (in the meantime) you select 'English (internal)' as language. You can do that from the application: Tools -> Configuration options -> General settings -> Language or modifying keynote.ini: LanguageUI=English (Internal) or simply: LanguageUI=<br>
<br><br><br>
Of course, I encourage you to make a backup of your .knt files before using the new version. It should be a healthy habit , particularly in version changes.<br>
<br>
<br><br>
It would be helpful that those of you who reported some of these issues verify and confirm if they are adequately resolved. I would also appreciate to verify other reported issues (as defect) that, although not in this list, are related to some of them, because they could have been corrected indirectly.<br>
Thanks
