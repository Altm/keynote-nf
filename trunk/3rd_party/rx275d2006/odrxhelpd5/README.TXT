I always need help to complete this help, so, send me your corrections 
and your enhancements. In particular, le OLE unit of the RxLib is mainly
undocumented at this time, can you help me to document this unit ?


How to install :

The best is to copy all files to Delphi\help folder, but you can put the files in the
folder you want...
Then execute ReghelpD3 or RegHelpD4 depending of your Delphi release (if you plan to
install help for both IDE, download the two versions, internal help links with the VCL
depend on the IDE release, keep different versions in different folders).
For Delphi 5 use the HlpReg.exe freeware in the zip. I tested it, that works fine.
(please, to be fair, see about box, and send a mail to author, I'm sure he will be glad :-)


Enjoy Delphi, the RxLib... and this help file : the only in the whole word including
all units, constants, types and objects of the Rx Lib...

Thanks for your help (passed or future) to enhance this help !
(send code sample, corrections and comments to my email adress at top of this
document).
