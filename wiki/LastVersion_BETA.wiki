*!KeyNote NF Last version (Beta)*

<br>
----
For those of you who want and can test new funcionality before new version is released:

This executable (*1.7.7 Beta*) includes the following issues:

  * Issue #101: Import files by dropping them on the tree
  * Issue #96: Search -> Find... only works on one note, won't search all notes
  * Issue #74: The treeview in the options dialog is editable
  * Issue #71: Node can become unchecked when moving, in a special situation
  * Issue #70: Status bar doesn't reflect correctly the modified state of the file
  * Issue #62: Keynote NF won't open in maximized window state
  * Issue #58: Minimizing button does not work
  * Issue #29: Sound for Alarm
  * Issue #73: Allow to enable or disable alarm popups

The executable can be downloaded from:
http://groups.google.com/group/keynote-nf/files

* I forgot to say that language files (.lng) are specific to each version. So, if Beta version doesn't include languages files, you will have to try it in English *

Soon I will publish a new BETA (this one with language files included, probably) with the following improvement: all the functionality of the program will manage properly UNICODE strings.

Soon I will release the version 1.7.9, but I think that maybe many of you will like to test the corrections and prefer not to wait to the other few issues I will include to begin using the new beta.

So, I have uploaded a executable (*1.7.9.1 Beta 1*) that includes the following issues:

  * Issue #61:  Improve lists (bullets and numbered lists): different styles, sublists, ...   	 
  * Issue #325: Relative paths in Links (relative to .knt file) 

  * Issue #251:  Alarm Text Entry can make !KeyNote to crash
  * Issue #258:  Alarm date displayed incorrectly when the day was the same as today
  * Issue #224:  Alarm window - date/time selection conflict - see screenshot
  * Issue #306:  Exception setting alarm in no saved files (untitled)
  * Issue #77:   Note display corrupted on resizing 	
  * Issue #107:  Name of new nodes created by 'New node from selection' and clipboard capture with option 'use clipboard text' may be too long
  * Issue #264:  Clipboard Capture with 'New node name' set to 'Use clipboard tex'" can cause the program to crash
  * Issue #136:  Find with 'search all notes' can cause Keynote to close
  * Issue #198:  Chinese characters detected erroneously as UTF8 in import
  * Issue #202:  Cyrillic plain text in old .knt files is shown as Western characters
  * Issue #200:  Inconsistent bullet indentation
  * Issue #208:  Notes with links scroll on save
  * Issue #213:  Clicking URLs in About menu results in Unexpected error: Invalid class typecast
  * Issue #242:  Links incorrectly formed in Windows 7
  * Issue #227:  Tab key causes tab to be inserted even if Note is set to "Read Only"
  * Issue #247:  Exit with automatic saving causes Keynote to open minimized next time
  * Issue #279:  Search all notes function can cause address violation
  * Issue #288:  Underscores are dropped while exported to single target files
  * Issue #294:  Minor bug on "Set Bookmark" and "Jump Bookmark" keyboard shortcuts
