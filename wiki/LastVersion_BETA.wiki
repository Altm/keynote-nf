*!KeyNote NF Last version (Beta)*

For those of you who want and can test new funcionality before new version is released:

This executable (*1.7.7 Beta*) includes the following issues:

  * Issue #101: Import files by dropping them on the tree
  * Issue #96: Search -> Find... only works on one note, won't search all notes
  * Issue #74: The treeview in the options dialog is editable
  * Issue #71: Node can become unchecked when moving, in a special situation
  * Issue #70: Status bar doesn't reflect correctly the modified state of the file
  * Issue #62: Keynote NF won't open in maximized window state
  * Issue #58: Minimizing button does not work
  * Issue #29: Sound for Alarm
  * Issue #73: Allow to enable or disable alarm popups

The executable can be downloaded from:

* I forgot to say that language files (.lng) are specific to each version. So, if Beta version doesn't include languages files, you will have to try it in English *

Soon I will publish a new BETA (this one with language files included, probably) with the following improvement: all the functionality of the program will manage properly UNICODE strings.
