*!KeyNote NF Last version (Beta)*

<br>
----
For those of you who want and can test new funcionality before new version is released:

This executable (*1.7.7 Beta*) includes the following issues:

  * Issue #101: Import files by dropping them on the tree
  * Issue #96: Search -> Find... only works on one note, won't search all notes
  * Issue #74: The treeview in the options dialog is editable
  * Issue #71: Node can become unchecked when moving, in a special situation
  * Issue #70: Status bar doesn't reflect correctly the modified state of the file
  * Issue #62: Keynote NF won't open in maximized window state
  * Issue #58: Minimizing button does not work
  * Issue #29: Sound for Alarm
  * Issue #73: Allow to enable or disable alarm popups

The executable can be downloaded from:
http://groups.google.com/group/keynote-nf/files

* I forgot to say that language files (.lng) are specific to each version. So, if Beta version doesn't include languages files, you will have to try it in English *

Soon I will publish a new BETA (this one with language files included, probably) with the following improvement: all the functionality of the program will manage properly UNICODE strings.

Soon I will release the version 1.7.9, but I think that maybe many of you will like to test the corrections and prefer not to wait to the other few issues I will include to begin using the new beta.

So, I have uploaded a executable (*1.7.9.1 Beta 1*) that includes the following issues:

  * Issue #77:   Note display corrupted on resizing 	
  * Issue #107:  Name of new nodes created by 'New node from selection' and clipboard capture with option 'use clipboard text' may be too long
  * Issue #264:  Clipboard Capture with 'New node name' set to 'Use clipboard tex'" can cause the program to crash
  * Issue #136:  Find with 'search all notes' can cause Keynote to close
  * Issue #198:  Chinese characters detected erroneously as UTF8 in import

  * Issue #227:  Tab key causes tab to be inserted even if Note is set to "Read Only"
  * Issue #247:  Exit with automatic saving causes Keynote to open minimized next time
  * Issue #279:  Search all notes function can cause address violation
  * Issue #288:  Underscores are dropped while exported to single target files
  * Issue #294:  Minor bug on "Set Bookmark" and "Jump Bookmark" keyboard shortcuts

Note that the language files you have for the actual version (1.7.8) will not be applicable to this version. With the release of the final 1.7.9 version I will incorporate all the language files updated.

I recommend everybody to use this new version, although marked as Beta but remember:

- Beta releases include normally only 'keynote.exe'. In this case are also included: 'kntutils.dll', 'nodehead.rtf' and 'notehead.rtf'. The .rtf files are needed if you are having problems with export, specially with chinese language. 

You must download previously a complete version and then replace existing files with the ones included in the .rar file

- Also, **and important**, the language files are associated to specific versions and so the language files will not be compatible with the beta executable. It is necessary that (in the meantime) you select 'English (internal)' as language. You can do that from the application: Tools -> Configuration options -> General settings -> Language or modifying keynote.ini: LanguageUI=English (Internal) or simply: LanguageUI=
<br><br><br>
Of course, I encourage you to make a backup of your .knt files before using the new version. It should be a healthy habit , particularly in version changes.

It would be helpful that those of you who reported some of these issues verify and confirm if they are adequately resolved. I would also appreciate to verify other reported issues (as defect) that, although not in this list, are related to some of them, because they could have been corrected indirectly.
Thanks
