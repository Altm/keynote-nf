Version: 1.7.4 Rev.2 -  date: 02/Jan/2009

Bugfixes:

 * Issue #20: Paste with Shift-Insert: as Text

 * Issue #21: Changing font style of a selection

-------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.4 -  date: 29/Dec/2008

Enhancements:

 * Issue #12: Improving the way links are managed. In new versions of Rich Edit is used the command RTF:
	     {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "hyperlink"}}{\fldrslt{\cf1\ul textOfHyperlink}}}
	     Now hyperlinks can show a text different to the URL.

 * Issue #7: More general and improved use of usual clipboard's shortcuts:
             Ctrl-C, CTRL-V, Ctrl-X  / Ctrl-Ins, Shift-Ins, Shift-Supr.
             That way is possible to copy and paste nodes and subtrees, and move (cut and paste) inside the file.

Bugfixes:

 * Issue #10: Changing First Indent of selection with several lines.
 	      Resolved in a better way, using PFM_OFFSETINDENT in RichEdit, instead of PFM_STARTINDENT
              Now works ok, and don't consume the 'undo' mechanism.

 * Issue #9: Pressing Intro in an empty line with bullet or numbering list style,
	     should cause list style to be removed..

 * Issue #13: Behaviour of lists styles: When applying list styles, the first indent of list 
	      (bullet or numbering) is not homogeneous

 * Issue #14: Context menu for Note tabs didn't appear under cursor

 * Issue #15: It is allowing RETURN even in read-only mode

 * Issue #16: Failed to save after erasing a node with hidden childs

 * Issue #18: Inserting a node doesn't always shows ok if the previous one is hidden.

03 october 2008 - version 1.7.3.3

  * Fixed problem with function "Insert URL..." and "Insert Link to file...": it didn't  work. It just transported the first letter of the url. On correcting the cause of this error it has been also resolved the problem with option "Show word count in status bar". The behaviour of the status bar is now the usual in !KeyNote.

-------------------------------------------------------------
02 october 2008 - version 1.7.3.2

  * Issue related to Paste action was not correctly resolved. It could generate exceptions in certain situations caused by the behaviour of "msftedit.dll". I have implemented a different solution that never needs to open modal window !PasteSpecial.

-----------------------------------------------------------
30 september 2008 - version 1.7.3

  * Fixed problem with searches: using "msftedit.dll" messages EM_FINDTEXTEX doesn't work correctly. Instead I have used EM_FINDTEXTEXW, that uses search strings in Unicode.

  * Fixed issue related to Paste action: sometimes Paste was ignored, while Paste special still worked. Now that situation is detected and the actions followed by the program are:
    * first to try to paste in Rich Text Format (like !PasteSpecial but without UI, and selecting directly the format)
    * If action one didn't work (in very rare ocassions) then !KeyNote will open modal window of !PasteSpecial. And this allways work.

-----------------------------------------------------------
28 september 2007 - version 1.7.2

  * Added: Now, you can use and show **tables** correctly inside !KeyNote
    * This improvement is available from Windows XP SP1, by means of "msftedit.dll"
    * At the moment, to control the design of these tables you must use other programs like Excel or Word and paste then into your keynote file
    * This functionality is actually incompatible with option "Show word count in status bar" The option is simply ignored.

  * Minor improvements in alarm management:
    * You can close modal window with ESC
    * When you postpone an alarm, next visible alarm is selected and option applied is mantained as default for next one.
  * Fixed exception on Delete Style Definition. This error appeared when migration to Delphi 2006.


-----------------------------------------------------------
23 july 2008 - version 1.7.1 (Rev. 4)
  * Fixed exception raised when opening !KeyNote with impresion queue stopped (server RPC stopped)

-----------------------------------------------------------
16 july 2008 - version 1.7.1 (Rev. 3)
  * Fixed error relative to alarm setting: it raised an error on opening a document with alarms from another document with alarms, too (also, on reopening a document when was modified outside !KeyNote)

-----------------------------------------------------------
25 November 2007 - version 1.7.1
  * Added: setting of alarms, associated to nodes.

-----------------------------------------------------------
13 November 2007 - version 1.7.0

  * Added: Capacity to work with hidden nodes. Nodes can be hidden in two ways: 
    * Activating a mode wich automatically hides checked nodes (Show or Hide checked nodes) 
    * Filtering one note's nodes or all notes under a searching criterion (Filter Tree Note) 
   In searches (and filters) it is possible to select if to consider or not hidden nodes.
   If you click on a result relative of a hidden node, that node will be shown.
  * Added: Selecting checkboxes for all nodes is still posible. (View/Tree Checkboxes -- now View/All nodes Checkboxes) Besides, checkboxes can be shown only on children of selected nodes: (Children Checkbox) 

  * Fixed error that could affect searches, exports and sending of mail: in rare ocassions one node's content could prevent next nodes to be considered.
  * Fixed: checked state of a node is now mantained when moved (by drag and drop or by Shift and cursors) and also when nodo or subtree is transferred. At the moment, if a node with visible checkbox is moved to a parent node that doesn't show his children checkboxes, this moved node will not show its checkbox (but the checked state is mantained, it isn't lost)

  * Changed behaviour of ESC in Scratch window: instead of focusing note's control editor, keynote is minimized.
